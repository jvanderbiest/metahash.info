                            It doesn't matter what exchange you use as you will always be able to transfer crypto
                            between exchanges. Just keep in mind that sending coins from an exchange wallet to another
                            wallet most probably will involve a withdrawal fee.

                            Coin staking on an exchange is similar to coin delegation. With
                            exchange staking you leave your coins on the exchange and get rewarded for doing that.
                            Their reward will usually be less than the one you would receive with MHC coin delegation as
                            they also want to make a profit. It's a good alternative for
                            people who have trust in the exchange and don't want to go through the extra steps for coin
                            delegation.

                            With wallet forging, you take part in a daily lottery where an amount of MHC will be
                            randomly distributed between forgers. With active wallet forging, you have to stay online at
                            least for 4h a day to generate lottery tickets and have at least 1000MHC available. With
                            passive forging, you don't have to stay online and you can participate with 100MHC. <a

                            With coin delegation you are certain you will get rewarded by the network. You need a minimum
                            of 512 MHC to start delegation. You do not have to be online after you delegated your coins.

                            When you take part in a forging / delegation process you will not lose your coins. They are
                            frozen in your wallet but you still have full ownership. When they are frozen you cannot
                            use them in any other transactions. Make sure to only use the official applications from <a

                            With coin delegation, you receive a daily reward from the MetaHash network. The server also
                            receives a reward and they can give you part of that reward as well. You would normally see
                            this as part of the server description in the MetaGate #MetaForging application server list.

                        <span class="answer" i18n>
                            With coin delegation, your profits will be higher and the payout is daily. You would need to
                            set it up yourself but the ROI (Return of Investment) is around 30%. The benefit of managing
                            your coins in your own #MetaWallet is more secure than leaving them on an exchange (in case
                            they get hacked).<br />
                            Staking on CEX.IO is similar but they provide it automatically for you with a monthly
                            payout. You don't have to do anything, just leave your coins on the CEX.IO exchange.
                            Staking will give your a ROI of 20% on an annual basis. <a
